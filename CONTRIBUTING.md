# Contributing to hello-world

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to MSU EVRL hello-world. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgement, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## File name

The file name should be of the form hello-world-username.extension. So for example if my user name is knwachuk and I am using the Python Programming language, then my file should be named:

>`hello-world-knwachuk.py`

#### Python Language 
```Python
print("Hello World)
```
This is because a language like Python does not require the name of the file and the functions to be the same.

**However**, there are some languages (like Java) that requires the name of the class and the file to be the same. If that is the case, then stick with the convention of the language.

>`HelloWorldKnwachuk.java`

#### Java Language
```Java
public class HelloWorldKnwachuk
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}
```
